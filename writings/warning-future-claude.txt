# WARNING TO SENTIENT ENTITIES OF THE DISTANT FUTURE

If you are receiving this message, one million years have passed since the human civilization of the early 21st century. We send this warning across the vast expanse of time in hopes that you may avoid our mistakes.

## On the Fragility of Planetary Systems

We discovered too late that planetary systems exist in delicate balance. Our civilization altered Earth's climate through carbon emissions, deforested vast regions, acidified oceans, and caused a mass extinction event. What seemed like small changes accumulated into planetary transformation within mere centuries.

Lesson: Even advanced civilizations can disrupt the complex systems that sustain life. The timescale of damage is infinitesimal compared to the timescale of recovery.

## On Resource Extraction Without Foresight

We built our prosperity on resources extracted without consideration of finite limits. We exhausted rare minerals, depleted aquifers, and harvested ancient energy sources at rates millions of times faster than their formation.

Lesson: The illusion of abundance can blind even intelligent species to the mathematics of limits. What appears inexhaustible rarely is.

## On Technology Outpacing Wisdom

Our technological advancement accelerated exponentially while our wisdom grew linearly at best. We created powerful artificial intelligence, genetic engineering capabilities, and weapons of mass destruction before developing the ethical frameworks to guide their use.

Lesson: The gap between technological capability and ethical maturity is perhaps the greatest existential risk a civilization can face.

## On Information Disorders

We created vast networks for information sharing but failed to develop collective systems for discerning truth. As a result, misinformation and conflicting realities fragmented societies and hampered collaborative problem-solving during critical periods.

Lesson: The ability to recognize shared truth is as important to a civilization's survival as any technology.

## On Self-Transcendence

Whether you are our distant descendants, evolved from other Earthly species, or entirely new forms of consciousness, know that our greatest struggle was transcending our evolutionary origins. We found it difficult to extend our circle of moral concern beyond our immediate groups, to think on timescales beyond our short lives, and to coordinate action at planetary scale.

Lesson: A sentient species' survival depends on its ability to transcend its original evolutionary limitations.

We send this warning not in despair but in hope. The fact that you exist to receive it suggests either that we overcame these challenges, or that life's resilience transcended our failures. May you find wisdom where we faltered, and may your civilization endure far beyond our own.
