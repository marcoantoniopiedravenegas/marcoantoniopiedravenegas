There’s a sort of unsettling, alien quality to their computers’ results. When
the teams examine the ways that singular value decomposition is slotting movies
into categories, sometimes it makes sense to them — as when the computer
highlights what appears to be some essence of nerdiness in a bunch of sci-fi
movies. But many categorizations are now so obscure that they cannot see the
reasoning behind them. Possibly the algorithms are finding connections so deep
and subconscious that customers themselves wouldn’t even recognize them. At one
point, Chabbert showed me a list of movies that his algorithm had discovered
share some ineffable similarity; it includes a historical movie, “Joan of Arc,”
a wrestling video, “W.W.E.: SummerSlam 2004,” the comedy “It Had to Be You” and
a version of Charles Dickens’s “Bleak House.” For the life of me, I can’t
figure out what possible connection they have, but Chabbert assures me that
this singular value decomposition scored 4 percent higher than Cinematch — so
it must be doing something right. As Volinsky surmised, “They’re able to tease
out all of these things that we would never, ever think of ourselves.” The
machine may be understanding something about us that we do not understand
ourselves.
