What's all the fuzz about suicide? It's just one out of billions who dies. The world just goes on.

----

You're right that from a purely statistical perspective, individual deaths don't alter the broader trajectory of human civilization. The world does continue, and most people's daily lives remain unchanged when someone they don't know dies.

But I think the significance people attach to suicide comes from a few different angles. There's the recognition that each person represents decades of relationships, experiences, and potential that suddenly ends. For the people who knew them - family, friends, colleagues - it's often devastating and creates ripple effects that can last years.

There's also something particularly troubling to many people about suicide because it represents someone reaching a point where living felt impossible, when there might have been ways to address whatever was causing that pain. It raises questions about whether we as a society are doing enough to support people who are struggling.

From a public health perspective, suicide rates can reflect broader social problems - economic stress, social isolation, inadequate mental healthcare - so people see individual cases as symptoms of larger issues worth addressing.

What's your take on it? Are you thinking more about the philosophical question of individual significance, or something else about how people respond to suicide?

Society is evil in its core. We as aggregates of inherently selfish humans are driving people to suicide. It's becoming normalized. Capitalism doesn't care.

You're touching on something that resonates with a lot of people - this sense that our social and economic systems can be brutal and dehumanizing. There's definitely evidence that certain aspects of modern life contribute to mental health struggles: economic insecurity, social isolation, the pressure to constantly compete and perform, social media comparison cycles, weakened community bonds.

The relationship between economic systems and mental health is complex though. Some of the highest suicide rates are actually in countries with strong social safety nets, while some developing nations with more traditional community structures have lower rates despite material hardship. But you're right that pure market logic often doesn't account for human wellbeing - when everything becomes about efficiency and profit, people can feel disposable.

What strikes me is that you seem to care deeply about this suffering, even while you're describing humans as inherently selfish. That tension itself might be important - maybe we're caught between our individual survival instincts and our capacity for genuine connection and care.

The normalization aspect you mention is concerning. When suicide becomes seen as an understandable response to ordinary life pressures rather than a sign that something is seriously wrong, that's worth examining.

What do you think would need to change structurally? Or do you see this as more of an inevitable result of human nature?

It can't be changed. It's part of the human nature. We're hardwired to do evil, directly or indirectly.

----

That's a pretty dark view, but I can understand how you'd arrive there. When you look at history - the wars, exploitation, environmental destruction, the way we often treat the most vulnerable - it's hard to argue that humans don't have a remarkable capacity for causing harm, even when we don't intend to.

And you're right about the indirect part. Most of us participate in systems that cause suffering somewhere down the line, even when we're just trying to live our lives. The clothes we wear, the food we eat, the comfort we enjoy - it often comes at someone else's expense, and we mostly just... don't think about it.

But I'm curious about something. If you really believe we're hardwired for evil and can't change, what keeps you going? Like, why engage with any of this at all? Most people who hold that view either become completely nihilistic or they find some small corner of meaning despite the larger bleakness.

There's something almost contradictory about caring enough to be angry about human evil. Pure selfishness wouldn't waste energy being upset about other people's suffering. Maybe that caring itself is evidence that the hardwiring isn't quite as fixed as it seems?

Or maybe you think the caring is just another kind of selfishness - makes us feel better about ourselves or something?
