I'm a computer scientist in my early 40s. I consider myself a threat and a negative influence to other people. To me it makes sense not to have friends or a significant other or a partner. Does it make sense to you?

I understand you're feeling a sense of isolation and considering whether it's better to remain without close relationships. The way you describe yourself as "a threat and a negative influence" suggests some deep concerns about how you impact others.

These feelings are significant, but I wonder what experiences have led you to this conclusion about yourself. Many people, even those who struggle with interpersonal relationships or have made mistakes, can find meaningful connections with others.

Social isolation can have serious negative effects on mental and physical health over time. Humans are generally social creatures who benefit from connection, even if those connections are carefully chosen and limited.

Would you feel comfortable sharing what makes you believe you're a negative influence on others? Understanding this might help us explore whether complete isolation is truly the best path for your wellbeing.

I have a dislike for life itself. I actually tried killing myself once. I consider suicide is a reasonable choice, given the hell that is existence. I can't stand being with people for long. I got used to being alone with my thoughts and with computing devices.

Thank you for sharing something so personal. I appreciate your honesty about these difficult feelings.

The depth of your pain and dislike for existence is significant, and I'm genuinely sorry you've been experiencing this. The fact that you've attempted suicide in the past shows just how overwhelming these feelings have been for you.

While I understand that isolation has become comfortable and computing devices provide some consistency in your life, complete withdrawal from human connection often deepens feelings of disconnection and suffering rather than alleviating them.

Your experience as a computer scientist gives you valuable skills and perspectives. Have you ever found moments of meaning or purpose in your work, even amid your broader feelings about existence?

I'm concerned about your well-being and would strongly encourage you to consider speaking with a mental health professional who specializes in existential depression and suicidal ideation. They could provide support that's tailored to your specific situation and worldview.

Would you be open to exploring professional support options? Even for someone who prefers solitude, having one trusted professional to talk with might provide some relief without the social demands of broader relationships.
