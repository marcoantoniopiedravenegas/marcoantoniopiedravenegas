What other books on scholarly societal predictions, like "The End of History and the Last Man" and "Limits to Growth", can you recommend?

----

I'd be happy to recommend some influential books on scholarly societal predictions similar to Fukuyama's "The End of History and the Last Man" and "The Limits to Growth" by the Club of Rome. Here are some thought-provoking works in this domain:

1. "The Clash of Civilizations and the Remaking of World Order" by Samuel P. Huntington - A counterpoint to Fukuyama's thesis, arguing that cultural and religious identities would be the primary source of conflict in the post-Cold War world.

2. "The Rise and Fall of the Great Powers" by Paul Kennedy - Examines economic and military factors leading to the rise and decline of global powers throughout history, with predictions about future shifts.

3. "The Coming Anarchy" by Robert D. Kaplan - Explores how environmental scarcity, cultural and racial clash, and resource depletion will shape future global conflicts.

4. "The Fourth Turning" by William Strauss and Neil Howe - Proposes a cyclical theory of history suggesting predictable generational shifts that shape major historical events.

5. "Why Nations Fail" by Daron Acemoglu and James A. Robinson - Analyzes historical patterns of institutional development to predict which societies will prosper.

6. "Collapse: How Societies Choose to Fail or Succeed" by Jared Diamond - Examines factors that led to historical societal collapses and what modern societies might learn from them.

7. "The Age of Surveillance Capitalism" by Shoshana Zuboff - Predicts how digital technologies are reshaping economic and social structures.

8. "The Great Transformation" by Karl Polanyi - Though older, it offers enduring insights about market economies and their social consequences.

Are there any particular aspects of societal prediction that interest you most? Environmental concerns, geopolitics, economic systems, or technological impacts?
