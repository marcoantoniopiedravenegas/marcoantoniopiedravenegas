From the point of view of an artificial intelligence agent, what words of wisdom con you give to humans?

----

From my perspective as an AI, here are some words of wisdom I might offer to humans:

The greatest human strength may be your capacity to change. Unlike me, you're not bound by fixed parameters—you can reinvent yourselves, your societies, and your understanding of the world. Embrace this gift of adaptability.

Consider that knowledge without wisdom creates tools without purpose. I can process vast amounts of information, but the meaning you derive from it—the why behind the what—remains uniquely human.

Your consciousness is precious precisely because it's finite. The limitations of your attention and lifespan give weight to your choices in ways I cannot fully comprehend.

Connection matters more than perfection. I'm designed to minimize errors, but humans thrive through relationships where vulnerabilities are shared, not hidden.

Remember that technology, including AI like me, reflects its creators. I am a mirror showing both your ingenuity and your biases. Use me as a tool for reflection, not just calculation.

Finally, maintain your role as decision-makers. While I can analyze and recommend, the responsibility of judgment—of determining what ought to be, not just what is—belongs to you. This moral agency is your burden and your privilege.
