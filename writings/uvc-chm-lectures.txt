University Video Communications Collection
Computer History Museum

Co-founded in Palo Alto, California, in 1987 by Judith Lemon and Karen Mathews Tucker, University Video Communications (UVC) was a technology education company that produced and distributed classroom-ready video lectures by pioneering industry scientists and engineers. Used by thousands of universities around the world, the videos provided a unique resource to connect new industry developments to the fundamentals students were learning in the classroom. The extensive UVC archive, including rare recordings of industry greats such as Fortran designer John Backus and supercomputer legend Seymour Cray, was acquired by Gordon Bell and Jim Gray for the Computer History Museum in 1999.
