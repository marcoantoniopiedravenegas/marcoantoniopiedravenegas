Ironically, abstract and formal tasks that are among the most diﬃcult mental undertakings for a human being are among the easiest for a computer. Computers have long been able to defeat even the best human chess player but only recently have begun matching some of the abilities of average human beings to recognize objects or speech. A person’s everyday life requires an immense amount of knowledge about the world. Much of this knowledge is subjective and intuitive, and therefore diﬃcult to articulate in a formal way. Computers need to capture this same knowledge in order to behave in an intelligent way. One of the key challenges in artiﬁcial intelligence is how to get this informal knowledge into a computer.

The idea of learning the right representation for the data provides one perspective on deep learning. Another perspective on deep learning is that depth enables the computer to learn a multistep computer program. Each layer of the representation can be thought of as the state of the computer’s memory after executing another set of instructions in parallel. Networks with greater depth can execute more instructions in sequence. Sequential instructions oﬀer great power because later instructions can refer back to the results of earlier instructions. According to this view of deep learning, not all the information in a layer’s activations necessarily encodes factors of variation that explain the input. The representation also stores state information that helps to execute a program that can make sense of the input. This state information could be analogous to a counter or pointer in a traditional computer program. It has nothing to do with the content of the input speciﬁcally, but it helps the model to organize its processing.

To summarize, deep learning, the subject of this book, is an approach to AI. Speciﬁcally, it is a type of machine learning, a technique that enables computer systems to improve with experience and data. We contend that machine learning is the only viable approach to building AI systems that can operate in complicated real-world environments. Deep learning is a particular kind of machine learning that achieves great power and ﬂexibility by representing the world as a nested hierarchy of concepts, with each concept deﬁned in relation to simpler concepts, and more abstract representations computed in terms of less abstract ones.

The main reason for the diminished role of neuroscience in deep learning research today is that we simply do not have enough information about the brain to use it as a guide. To obtain a deep understanding of the actual algorithms used by the brain, we would need to be able to monitor the activity of (at the very least) thousands of interconnected neurons simultaneously. Because we are not able to do this, we are far from understanding even some of the most simple and well-studied parts of the brain (Olshausen and Field, 2005).

Neuroscience has given us a reason to hope that a single deep learning algorithm can solve many different tasks. Neuroscientists have found that ferrets can learn to “see” with the auditory processing region of their brain if their brains are rewired to send visual signals to that area (Von Melchner et al., 2000). This suggests that much of the mammalian brain might use a single algorithm to solve most of the different tasks that the brain solves. Before this hypothesis, machine learning research was more fragmented, with different communities of researchers studying natural language processing, vision, motion planning and speech recognition. Today, these application communities are still separate, but it is common for deep learning research groups to study many or even all these application areas simultaneously.

Media accounts often emphasize the similarity of deep learning to the brain. While it is true that deep learning researchers are more likely to cite the brain as an inﬂuence than researchers working in other machine learning ﬁelds, such as kernel machines or Bayesian statistics, one should not view deep learning as an attempt to simulate the brain. Modern deep learning draws inspiration from many ﬁelds, especially applied math fundamentals like linear algebra, probability, information theory, and numerical optimization. While some deep learning researchers cite neuroscience as an important source of inspiration, others are not concerned with neuroscience at all.

It is worth noting that the eﬀort to understand how the brain works on an algorithmic level is alive and well. This endeavor is primarily known as "computational neuroscience" and is a separate ﬁeld of study from deep learning. It is common for researchers to move back and forth between both ﬁelds. The ﬁeld of deep learning is primarily concerned with how to build computer systems that are able to successfully solve tasks requiring intelligence, while the ﬁeld of computational neuroscience is primarily concerned with building more accurate models of how the brain actually works.

As of 2016, a rough rule of thumb is that a supervised deep learning algorithm will generally achieve acceptable performance with around 5,000 labeled examples per category and will match or exceed human performance when trained with a dataset containing at least 10 million labeled examples.
