*** Introduction:

Certain questions and topics come up frequently in the various network
discussion groups devoted to and related to Artificial Intelligence
(AI).  This file/article is an attempt to gather these questions and
their answers into a convenient reference for AI researchers. It is
posted on a monthly basis. The hope is that this will cut down on the
user time and network bandwidth used to post, read and respond to the
same questions over and over, as well as providing education by
answering questions some readers may not even have thought to ask.

The latest version of this FAQ is NO-LONGER available via anonymous
FTP from:
   ftp://ftp.cs.ucla.edu/pub/AI/
as the files ai_[1-7].faq.

The cannonical source is now:
   http://www.faqs.org/faqs/ai-faq/general

The FAQ postings are also archived in the periodic posting archive on

   rtfm.mit.edu:/pub/usenet/news.answers/ai-faq/general/ [18.181.0.24]

If you do not have anonymous ftp access, you can access the archive by
mail server as well.  Send an E-mail message to mail-server@rtfm.mit.edu

----------------------------------------------------------------
Subject: [1-0] What is the purpose of the newsgroup comp.ai?

Comp.ai is a moderated newsgroup whose topic is Artificial Intelligence.
It has existed since the early days of USENET (at least 10 years) and
has been a moderated newsgroup since 5th May 1999.  An introduction for 
new readers including the official charter, moderation policies and
posting guidelines may be found at <http://www.cs.mu.oz.au/~dnk/comp.ai>.
The current moderator is David Kinny, but the actual moderation is done
largely automatically by an intelligent :-) agent (the AI-mod-bot).
 
The group is meant for general discussion of AI topics (but not about
those for which specialized subgroups already exist), including:
 
o  announcements of AI conferences, reports, books, products and jobs.
o  questions and discussion about AI theory and practice, algorithms,
     systems and applications, problems, history and future trends.
o  distribution of AI source code (preferably indirectly by weblinks)
 
All contributions should be of potential interest to the general AI 
community, and in English plain text without attachments.  See part 2 
of this FAQ for a list of other more specialized newsgroups and lists.

Every so often, somebody posts an inflammatory message, such as

   Will computers ever really think?
   AI hasn't done anything worthwhile.

These "religious" issues serve no real purpose other than to waste
bandwidth. If you feel the urge to respond to such a post, please do
so through a private e-mail message, or post redirecting follow-ups to
comp.ai.philosophy.  We suspect this will be less of a problem now
that the group is moderated.

We've tried to minimize the overlap with the FAQ postings to the
comp.lang.lisp, comp.lang.prolog, comp.ai.neural-nets, and
comp.ai.shells newsgroups, so if you don't find what you're looking
for here, we suggest you try the FAQs for those newsgroups. These FAQs
should be available by anonymous ftp in subdirectories of

   rtfm.mit.edu:/pub/usenet/

or by sending a mail message to mail-server@rtfm.mit.edu with subject
"help". http://www.faqs.org/ has a nice webified version.

----------------------------------------------------------------
Subject: [1-1] I have a Question not covered in the FAQ...

This FAQ tries to answer many introductory issues in Artificial
Intelligence, but there are many questions it cannot or does not
answer.  While the FAQ maintainers welcome email about the FAQ and AI
in general, the proper place to ask AI questions is the comp.ai
newsgroup itself - that's what it's for.  As a practical issue, the
maintainers reply to FAQ related mail on a monthly basis, so replies
to questions are likely to be delayed.

----------------------------------------------------------------
Subject: [1-2] What is AI?

Artificial intelligence ("AI") can mean many things to many people.
Much confusion arises because the word 'intelligence' is ill-defined.
The phrase is so broad that people have found it useful to divide AI
into two classes: strong AI and weak AI.

----------------------------------------------------------------
Subject: [1-3] What's the difference between strong AI and weak AI?

Strong AI makes the bold claim that computers can be made to think on
a level (at least) equal to humans and possibly even be conscious of
themselves.  Weak AI simply states that some "thinking-like" features
can be added to computers to make them more useful tools... and this
has already started to happen (witness expert systems, drive-by-wire
cars and speech recognition software).  What does 'think' and
'thinking-like' mean?  That's a matter of much debate.

----------------------------------------------------------------
Subject: [1-4] I have little/no background in CompSci/AI, can you tell
	       me in detail how AI works?

No.  AI is a scientific and engineering discipline depending on
sophisticated Computer Science techniqes, mathematics, etc.  It also
is sub-divided into many distinct subfields.  At the International
Joint Conference on Artificial Intelligence in 2003, the program
committee divided the papers into nearly forty different topic areas.
It is not really practical to expect to understand the technical
details of AI from a USENET forum.

On the other hand, it is possible to get the general gist of the field
from several books.  If you have a computer science background, you
should investigate one of the texts listed in question [4-0].  If you
don't, then you may be interested in Raymond Kurzweil's "The Age of
Intelligent Machines".

----------------------------------------------------------------
Subject: [1-5] I'm a programmer interested in AI.  Where do I start?

There's a list of introductory AI texts in the bibliography section
of the FAQ [4-0].  Also, check out the web links in section [5-2].

  [1-5a] I'm writing a game that needs AI.
  
  It depends what the game does.  If it's a two-player board game,
  look into the "Mini-max" search algorithm for games (see [4-1]).  In
  most commercial games, the AI is is a combination of high-level
  scripts and low-level efficiently-coded, real-time, rule-based
  systems.  Often,  commercial games tend to use finite state machines
  for computer players.  Recently, discrete Markov models have been used
  to simulate unpredictible human players (the buzzword compliant name
  being "fuzzy" finite state machines).
  
  A recent popular game, "Black and White", used machine learning
  techniques for the non-human controlled characters.  Basic
  reinforcement learning, perceptrons and decision trees were all
  parts of the learning system.  Is this the begining of academic AI
  in video games?

----------------------------------------------------------------
Subject: [1-6] What's an agent?

A very misused term.  Today, an agent seems to mean a stand-alone
piece of AI-ish software that scours across the internet doing
something "intelligent."  Russell and Norvig define it as "anything
that can can be viewed a perceiving its environment through sensors
and acting upon that environment through effectors."  Several papers
I've read treat it as 'any program that operates on behalf of a
human,' similar to its use in the phrase 'travel agent'.  Marvin
Minsky has yet another definition in the book "Society of Mind."
Minsky's hypothesis is that a large number of seemingly-mindless
agents can work together in a society to create an intelligent society
of mind.  Minsky theorizes that not only will this be the basis of
computer intelligence, but it is also an explaination of how human
intelligence works.  Andrew Moore at Carnegie Mellon University once
remarked that "The only proper use of the word 'agent' is when
preceded by the words 'travel', 'secret', or 'double'."

----------------------------------------------------------------
Subject: [1-7] History of AI.

The appendix to Ray Kurzweil's book "Intelligent Machines" (MIT Press,
1990, ISBN 0-262-11121-7, $39.95) gives a timeline of the history of AI.

Intelligence", Technical Report CMU-CS-82-142, Carnegie Mellon

   The introductory material in:
   Russell, S and Norvig, P, "Artificial Intelligence: A Modern
   Approach", Prentice Hall, 1995
   is also quite good.

----------------------------------------------------------------
Subject: [1-8] What has AI accomplished?

Quite a bit, actually.  In 'Computing machinery and intelligence.',
Alan Turing, one of the founders of computer science, made the claim
that by the year 2000, computers would be able to pass the Turing test
at a reasonably sophisticated level, in particular, that the average
interrogator would not be able to identify the computer correctly more
than 70 per cent of the time after a five minute conversation.  AI
hasn't quite lived upto Turing's claims, but quite a bit of progress
has been made, including:

- Deployed speech dialog systems by firms like IBM, Dragon and Lernout&Hauspie

- Financial software, which is used by banks to scan credit card
  transactions for unusual patterns that might signal fraud. One piece
  of software is estimated to save banks $500 million annually.

- Applications of expert systems/case-based reasoning: a computerized Leukemia
  diagnosis system did a better job checking for blood disorders than human
  experts.

- Machine translation for Environment Canada: software developed in the 1970s
  translated natural language weather forcasts between English and French.
  Purportedly stil in use.

- Deep Blue, the first computer to beat the human chess Grandmaster

- Physical design analysis programs,such as for buildings and highways.

- Fuzzy controllers in dishwashers, etc.

One persistent 'problem' is that as soon as an AI technique trully
succeeds, in the minds of many it ceases to be AI, becoming something
like Engineering.  For example, when Deep Blue defeated Kasparov,
there were many who said Deep Blue wasn't AI, since after all it was
just a brute force parallel minimax search, despite minimax search
being one of the great early successes of AI.  Nowadays, people are
still studying all sorts of things that are currently considered the
prerequisites of intelligence, such as intuition and emotion, but you
can bet that if and when they solve some part, some will say "oh,
that's just Engineering..."

Subject: [1-9] What are the branches of AI?

There are many, some are 'problems' and some are 'techniques'.

    Automatic Programming - The task of describing what a program
        should do and having the AI system 'write' the program.

    Bayesian Networks - A technique of structuring and inferencing
        with probabilistic information.  (Part of the "machine learning"
	problem).

    Constraint Statisfaction - solving NP-complete problems, using a
        variety of techniques.

    Knowledge Engineering/Representation - turning what we know about
	a particular domain into a form in which a computer can
	understand it. 

    Machine Learning - Programs that learn from experience or data.

    Natural Language Processing(NLP) - Processing and (perhaps)
        understanding human ("natural") language.  Also known as
	computational linguistics.

    Neural Networks(NN) - The study of programs that function in a
        manner similar to how animal brains do.

    Planning - given a set of actions, a goal state, and a present state,
	decide which actions must be taken so that the present state
	is turned into the goal state

    Robotics - The intersection of AI and robotics, this field tries
        to get (usually mobile) robots to act intelligently.

    Speech Recogntion - Conversion of speech into text.

    Search - The finding of a path from a start state to a goal
        state. Similar to planning, yet different...

    Visual Pattern Recognition - The ability to reproduce the
	human sense of sight on a machine.

AI problems (speech recognition, NLP, vision, automatic programming,
knowledge representation, etc.) can be paired with techniques (NN,
search, Bayesian nets, production systems, etc.)  to make distinctions
such as search-based NLP vs. NN NLP vs. Statistical/Probabilistic NLP.
Then you can combine techniques, such as using neural networks to
guide search.  And you can combine problems, such as posing that
knowledge representation and language are equivalent.  (Or you can
combine AI with problems from other domains.)

----------------------------------------------------------------
Subject: [1-10] What are good programming languages for AI?

This topic can be somewhat sensitive, so I'll probably tread on a few
toes, please forgive me.  There is no authoritative answer for this
question, as it really depends on what languages you like programming
in.  AI programs have been written in just about every language ever
created.  The most common seem to be Lisp, Prolog, C/C++,  recently
Java, and even more recently, Python.

LISP- For many years, AI was done as research in universities and
laboratories, thus fast prototyping was favored over fast execution.
This is one reason why AI has favored high-level langauges such as
Lisp.  This tradition means that current AI Lisp programmers can draw
on many resources from the community.  Features of the language that
are good for AI programming include: garbage collection, dynamic
typing, functions as data, uniform syntax, interactive environment,
and extensibility. Read Paul Graham's essay, "Beating the Averages"
for a discussion of some serious advantages:
http://www.paulgraham.com/avg.html

PROLOG- This language wins 'cool idea' competition.  It wasn't until
the 70s that people began to realize that a set of logical statements
plus a general theorem prover could make up a program.  Prolog
combines the high-level and traditional advantages of Lisp with a
built-in unifier, which is particularly useful in AI.  Prolog seems to
be good for problems in which logic is intimately involved, or whose
solutions have a succinct logical characterization.  Its major
drawback (IMHO) is that it's hard to learn.

C/C++- The speed demon of the bunch, C/C++ is mostly used when the
program is simple, and excecution speed is the most important.
Statistical AI techniques such as neural networks are common examples
of this.  Backpropagation is only a couple of pages of C/C++ code, and
needs every ounce of speed that the programmer can muster.

Java- The newcomer, Java uses several ideas from Lisp, most notably
garbage collection.  Its portability makes it desirable for just about
any application, and it has a decent set of built in types.  Java is
still not as high-level as Lisp or Prolog, and not as fast as C,
making it best when portability is paramount.

Python- This language does not have widespread acceptance yet, but
several people have suggested to me that it might end up passing Java
soon.  Apparently the new edition of the Russell-Norvig textbook will
include Python source as well as Lisp.  According to Peter Norvig,
"Python can be seen as either a practical (better libraries) version
of Scheme, or as a cleaned-up (no $@&%) version of Perl."  For more
information, especially on how Python compares to Lisp, go to
http://norvig.com/python-lisp.html

Also see section [6-1] for implementations of new languages that might
be pertainant to AI practitioners and researchers.

(some of the above material is due to the comp.lang.prolog FAQ, and
Norvig's "Paradigms of Artificial Intelligence Programming: Case
Studies in Common Lisp")

----------------------------------------------------------------
Subject: [1-11] What's the difference between "classical" AI and
"statistical" AI?

Statistical AI, arising from machine learning, tends to be more
concerned with "inductive" thought: given a set of patterns, induce
the trend.  Classical AI, on the other hand, is more concerned with
"deductive" thought: given a set of constraints, deduce a conclusion.
Another difference, as mentioned in the previous question, is that C++
tends to be a favourite language for statistical AI while LISP
dominates in classical AI.

A system can't be truly intelligent without displaying properties of
both inductive and deductive thought.  This lends many to beleive that
in the end, there will be some kind of synthesis of statistical and
classical AI.

----------------------------------------------------------------
Subject: [1-12] I have the idea for an AI Project that will solve all
of AI... 

Great!  Welcome to the club and tell us all about it.  Most poeple in
the community genuinely want new people to be thinking about AI.  You
should be aware that you will probably not get a whole lot of
enthusiasm from the established scientists for a few reasons:

- We receive or hear about such proposals about once a month.  The
  vast majority are naive.

- Many smart people have been thinking about the AI problem for a long
  time.  There have been many ideas that have been pursued by
  sophisticated research teams which turned out to be dead ends.  This
  includes all of the obvious ideas.  Most grand solutions proposed
  have been seen before (about 70% seem to be recapitulations of
  Minsky proposals).

- The grand ideas are almost always far too vague to implement.  One
  of the tough lessons of graduate school is how to turn a vague idea
  into something that is implementable and testable.  Unless you have
  experience at it, it is unlikely your first try will have the needed
  precision. 

- It is the general opinion of the research community that we're just
  not ready to solve the general AI problem yet (cf. question on
  CYC).  Why that is should be addressed in another question.

OK, now that we've covered the harsh reality, you shouldn't get
discouraged.  If you're having fun with it, keep doing it.  You're
guaranteed to learn something while participating in a fascinating
hobby.  Who knows- you may still come up with a really great and new
idea.  Finally, [and this is just Ric's opinion] most of the really
interesting AI people started out because they had the same kind of
idea to make AI better than it is now.

----------------------------------------------------------------
Subject: [1-13] Glossary of AI terms.

This is the start of a simple glossary of short definitions for AI
terminology.  The purpose is not to present the gorey details, but
give ageneral idea.

   A*:
	A search algorithm to find the shortest path through a search
	space to a goal state using a heuristic.  See 'search',
	'problem space', 'Admissibility', and 'heuristic'.

   Admissibility:
        An admissible search algorithm is one that is guaranteed to
        find an optimal path from the start node to a goal node, if
        one exists. In A* search, an admissible heuristic is one that never
        overestimates the distance remaining from the current node to
        the goal. 

   Agent:
	"Anything that can can be viewed a perceiving its environment
	through sensors and acting upon that environment through
	effectors." [Russel, Norvig 1995]

   ai: 
        1. A three-toed sloth of genus Bradypus. This forest-dwelling
	animal eats the leaves of the trumpet-tree and sounds a
	high-pitched squeal when disturbed. (Based on the Random House
	dictionary definition.)  2. An ancient canaanite city that was
	occupied by the Israelites and is mentioned in the bible as
	well as in other ancient texts. (thanks to Omri Safren)

   Alpha-Beta Pruning: 
        A method of limiting search in the MiniMax algorithm.  The
        coolest thing you learn in an undergraduate course.  If done
        optimally, it reduces the branching factor from B to the
        square root of B.

   Animat Approach:
        The design and study of simulated animals or adaptive real robots
        inspired by animals.  (From www-poleia.lip6.fr/ANIMATLAB - click on
        "English page")

   Backward Chaining:
	In a logic system, reasoning from a query to the data.  See
	Forward chaining.

   Belief Network (also Bayesian Network):
	A mechanism for representing probabilistic knowledge.
	Inference algorithms in belief networks use the structure of
	the network to generate inferences effeciently (compared to
	joint probability distributions over all the variables).

   Breadth-first Search:
	An uninformed search algorithm where the shallowest node in
	the search tree is expanded first.

   Case-based Reasoning: 
        Technique whereby "cases" similar to the current problem are
        retrieved and their "solutions" modified to work on the current
        problem. 

   Closed World Assumption:
	The assumption that if a system has no knowledge about a
	query, it is false.

   Computational Linguistics:
	The branch of AI that deals with understanding human language.  Also
	called natural language processing.

   Data Mining:
	Also known as Knowledge Discovery in Databases (KDD) was been defined
	as "The nontrivial extraction of implicit, previously unknown, and
	potentially useful information from data" in Frawley and
	Piatetsky-Shapiro's overview.  It uses machine learning, statistical
	and visualization techniques to discover and present knowledge in a
	form which is easily comprehensible to humans.

   Depth-first Search:
	An uninformed search algorithm, where the deepest non-terminal
	node is expanded first.

   Embodiment:
        An approach to Artificial Intelligence that maintains that the
        only way to create general intelligence is to use programs
        with 'bodies' in the real world (i.e. robots).  It is an
        extreme form of Situatedness, first and most strongly put
        forth by Rod Brooks at MIT.

   Evaluation Function:
	A function applied to a game state to generate a guess as to
	who is winning.  Used by Minimax when the game tree is too
	large to be searched exhaustively.

   Forward Chaining:
	In a logic system, reasoning from facts to conclusions.  See
	Backward Chaining
 
   Fuzzy Logic:
        In Fuzzy Logic, truth values are real values in the closed
        interval [0..1]. The definitions of the boolean operators are
        extended to fit this continuous domain. By avoiding discrete
        truth-values, Fuzzy Logic avoids some of the problems inherent in
        either-or judgments and yields natural interpretations of utterances
        like "very hot". Fuzzy Logic has applications in control theory.

   Generate and Test:
	The basic model for performing search in any search space.
        "The purest form of `generate and test' is: 1. generate all
        the possible [options] that I would even remotely consider
        taking next, 2. test each [option] in the generated set to
        filter out bad ones, and possibly to prioritize the rest. How
        much you move away from this "pure" form depends on how much
        of the testing you try to move into the generation stage.
        What we often strive for in intelligent systems is:
        1. generate only the most appropriate action 2. no testing is
        needed But what we usually end up with is: 1. generate only
        the best candidates (moving some of the testing conditions
        into the generator), 2. perform a more strenuous test on the
        small set of generated actions, for a final selection"
        -Randolph_M._Jones <rjones@colby.edu>

   Heuristic:
        The dictionary defines it as a method that serves as an aid to
        problem solving.  It is sometimes defined as any 'rule of
        thumb'.  Technically, a heuristic is a function that takes a
        state as input and outputs a value for that state- often as a
        guess of how far away that state is from the goal state.  See
        also: Admissibility, Search.

   Information Extraction:
	Getting computer-understandable information from human-readable
	(ie natural language) documents.
	
   Iterative Deepening:
	An uninformed search that combines good properties of
	Depth-fisrt and Breadth-first search.

   Iterative Deepening A*:
	The ideas of iterative deepening applied to A*.

   Language Acquisition:
	A relatively new sub-branch of AI; traditionally computational
	linguists tried to make computers understand human language by
	giving the computer grammar rules.  Language acquisition is a
	technique for the computer to generate the grammar rules itself.

   Machine Learning:
	A field of AI concerned with programs that learn.  It includes
	Reinforcement Learning and Neural Networks among many other
	fields. 

   MiniMax:
	An algorithm for game playing in games with perfect
	information.  See alpha-beta pruning.

   Modus Ponens:
	An inference rule that says: if you know x and you know that
	'If x is true then y is true' then you can conclude y.

   Nonlinear Planning:
        A planning paradigm which does not enforce a total (linear)
        ordering on the components of a plan.

   Natural Language (NL):
	Evolved languages that humans use to communicate with one another.

   Natural Language Queries:
	Using human language to get information from a database.

   Partial Order Planner:
	A planner that only orders steps that need to be ordered, and
	leaves unordered any steps that can be done in any order.

   Planning:
	A field of AI concerned with systems that constuct sequences
	of actions to acheive goals in real-world-like environments.

   Problem Space (also State Space):
	The formulation of an AI problem into states and operators.
	There is usually a start state and a goal state.  The problem
	space is searched to find a solution.

   Search:
	The finding of a path from a start state to a goal state.  See
	'Admissibility', 'Problem Space', and 'Heuristic'.

   Situatedness:
        The property of an AI program being located in an environment
        that it senses.  Via its actions, the program can select its
        sensation input, as well as change its environment.
        Situatedness is often considered necessary in the Animat
        approach.  Some researchers claim that situatedness is key to
        understanding general intelligence.  (see Embodiment)

   Strong AI:           
        Claim that computers can be made to actually think, just like human
        beings do. More precisely, the claim that there exists a class of
        computer programs, such that any implementation of such a program is
        really thinking.

   Unification:
	The process of finding a substitution (an assignment of
	constants and variables to variables) that makes two logical
	statements look the same.

   Validation:
        The process of confirming that one's model uses measureable inputs
        and produces output that can be used to make decisions about the
        real world.

   Verification:
        The process of confirming that an implemented model works as intended.

   Weak AI:             
        Claim that computers are important tools in the modeling and
        simulation of human activity.

Subject: [1-14] In A*, why does the heuristic have to always
		underestimate? 

Recall that in A*, a number is assigned to each node, its f-cost.
f-cost is defined as f(n)=g(n)+h(n), where g(n) is the cost of
traveling to node n, and h(n) is the heuristic guess at traveling from
node n to the goal.  A* expands nodes based on minimal f-cost (i.e. it
looks at all the nodes it knows about but hasn't yet examined closely,
and picks the one with the smallest f(n)).  Let's look at the
following situation:

                                 +-+   
                                 |n|   
                                 +-+
       	       	       	       	/   \
			      +-+   +-+
                              |o|   |p|  
                              +-+   +-+ 
       	       	       	     / 	       \
			   +-+ 	       +-+ 	
      			   |g|---------|q|
			   +-+         +-+

n is an already expanded node, and A* is trying to decide if it wants
to expand o or p.  If g is the goal node, then o is on the shorter
path, so we want A* to pick o.  Lets assume that g(n) = 5 and the cost
between nodes is always 1.  Therefore g(o)=6 and g(p)=6.  Now lets
assume that our heuristic sometimes overestimates, so that h(o)=5,
h(p)=3 and h(q)=2. 

In this case, f(o)=g(o)+h(o) = 6+5=11
	      f(p)=g(p)+h(p) = 6+3=9,
so A* would expand p next, discovering node q.  Then it decides which
node to expand, f(o)=g(o)+h(o) = 6+5=11
		f(q)=g(q)+h(q) = 7+2=9,
so A* would expand q next, discovering g.  Then it decides which node
to expand, f(o)=g(o)+h(o) = 6+5=11
	   f(g)=g(g)+h(g) = 8+0=8,
So A* would discover node g, notice that it is a goal and return the
path n->p->q->g, which is _not_ the shortest path.

The intuition here is that the overestimate of h(o) led A* to look at
another path where the overestimate was less bad.

Subject: [1-15] I'm a student considering further study  AI. What information
                is there for me? 

Aaron Sloman has written an essay addressing this question, aimed at people
who know little about it.  Please see
http://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/~axs/misc/aiforschools.html

----------------------------------------------------------------
Subject: [1-16] What are best graduate schools for AI?

The short answer is: MIT, CMU, and Stanford are historically the
powerhouses of AI and still are the top 3 today.

There are however, hundreds of schools all over the world with at
least one or two active researchers doing interesting work in AI.
What is most important in graduate school is finding an advisor who is
doing something YOU are interested in.  Read about what's going on in
the field and then identify the the people in the field that are doing
that research you find most interesting.  If a professor and his
students are publishing frequently, then that should be a place to
consider. 
----------------------------------------------------------------
Subject: [1-17] No really, just give me a ranking of the best
		graduate schools for AI!

[stolen from Randy Crawford crwfrdDESPAM@umich.edu:] 

"A single number that assesses a CS department's worth across the
spectrum of AI topics has increasingly less meaning as you descend the
rankings.  Few schools can claim to have outstanding profs that
represent all areas in AI.  Perhaps no schools can.  As you descend
through school reputations from CMU/MIT/Stanford/UC Berkeley down, you
lose breadth as much as excellence.  It then becomes increasingly
important that you clearly define the subtopic in AI that you want
ranked...  What's more, reputations can change quickly.  Ten years ago
Yale was among the best in AI, and five years ago, Chicago was quite
strong.  Today, not."


----------------------------------------------------------------
Subject: [1-18] What are the ratings of the various AI journals?

ISI (Institute for Scientific Information NOT Information Sciences
Institute) produces an annual database called the Journal Impact
Factors.  Check your library.  Lee Giles has done a nice job of
extracting this information for some AI journals.  See:
http://www.neci.nj.nec.com/homepages/giles/Citation.index/

Thanks to Bob Fisher and Dean Hougen for this answer.

You might also want to look at CiteSeer "Earth's largest free
full-text index of scientific literature."  It also tracks citations.

For a somewhat complete list of AI journals listed by area, see part 3
of this FAQ.

Subject: [1-20] How can I get the email address for Joe or Jill
		Researcher? 

This question is an anachronism.  The correct way to get someone's
email address is to Google them.  If that fails, try posting to the
comp.ai newsgroup.

----------------------------------------------------------------
Subject: [1-21] What does it mean to say a 2-player game is 'solved'?
Is tic-tac-toe solved? How about game z?

We say a game is solved when we know for sure the result when both
players play optimally.  The result is either a guaranteed win for the
first player, a guaranteed win for the second player, or a draw.  We
find this out by searching the mini-max game tree to the game ending
positions.  If you do this for 3x3 tic-tac-toe, it is easy to see that it
is a forced draw. 

other games:
3x3x3 tic-tac-toe: win for the first player.
4x4x4 tic-tac-toe: win for the first player.
Connect-4: win for the first player.
Go-Moku: win for the first player.

[Maintainer's note: Please let us know about your favorite solved
game.] 

----------------------------------------------------------------
Subject: [1-22] What's this Information Theory thing?

Information Theory was developed to describe properties of
communication across networks.  It turns out that it has all sorts of
applcations in AI and machine learning as well.  A good tutorial can
be found at: 
http://www-2.cs.cmu.edu/~dst/Tutorials/Info-Theory/

----------------------------------------------------------------
Subject: [1-23] What AI competitions exist?

The Loebner Prize, based on a fund of over $100,000 established by New
York businessman Hugh G. Loebner, is awarded annually for the computer
program that best emulates natural human behavior. During the
contest, a panel of independent judges attempts to determine whether
the responses on a computer terminal are being produced by a computer
or a person, along the lines of the Turing Test. The designers of the
best program each year win a cash award and a medal. If a program
passes the test in all its particulars, then the entire fund will be
paid to the program's designer and the fund abolished. For further
information about the Loebner Prize, see the URL

The Robot World Cup Initiative (RoboCup) is an attempt to foster AI
and intelligent robotics research by providing a standard problem
where wide range of technologies can be integrated and examined. For
this purpose, RoboCup chose to use soccer game, and organize RoboCup:
The Robot World Cup Soccer Games and Conferences. In order for a robot
team to actually performa soccer game, various technologies must be
incorporated including: design principles of autonomous agents,
multi-agent collaboration, strategy acquisition, real-time reasoning,
robotics, and sensor-fusion.  RoboCup is a task for a team of multiple
fast-moving robots under a dynamic environment. RoboCup also offers a
software platform for research on the software aspects of RoboCup.

Subject: [1-26] Future Directions of AI

[Note:as of 2002, this is out of date.]

The purpose of this question is to compile a list of major ongoing and
future thrusts of AI. To be included in this list a research problem
or application must have the following characteristics:

   [1]  Collaborative Community Effort: It must span several subfields
        of AI, requiring some degree of collaboration between AI
        researchers of different specialties. The idea is to help
        unify the fragmented subfields with a common purpose or
        purposes. 

   [2]  High Impact: It must address important problems of widespread interest.
        Solving the problem must matter to many people and not simply
        be adding another grain of sand on the anthill. This will help
        motivate and excite researchers, and justify the field to outsiders.

   [3]  Short Horizon for Progress: It must be possible to have incremental
        progress and not be an all or nothing problem. For example,
        problems where we can reasonably expect to make significant
        measurable progress over the next 10 years or so.

   [4]  Drive Basic Research: It should involve more than just
        applying current technology, but should drive basic research
        and the development of new technology (possibly in completely
        new directions). 

In short, these problems should be "Grand Challenges" for AI. If you
were trying to describe the field of AI to a layman, what concrete
problems would you use to illustrate the overall vision of the field?
Saying that the goal of AI is to produce "thinking machines that solve
problems" doesn't quite cut it.

   o  Knowbots/Infobots, Web Agents and Intelligent Help Desks
         Unified NLU, NLG, Information Retrieval, KR, Reasoning,
         Intelligent User Interfaces, Qualitative Reasoning.

   o  Autonomous Vehicles
         Unified Robotics, Machine Vision, Machine Learning,
         Intelligent Control, Planning

   o  Machine Translation
         Unified NLU, NLG, Knowledge Representation, Speech Understanding,
         Speech Synthesis 

It seems appropriate to mention, in this context, some of the early
goals of AI.  In 1958 Newell and Simon predicted that computers would
-- by 1970 -- be capable of composing classical music, discovering
important new mathematical theorems, playing chess at grandmaster
level, and understanding and translating spoken language. Although
these predictions were overly optimistic, they did represent a set of
focused goals for the field of AI. [See H. A. Simon and A. Newell,
"Heuristic Problem Solving: The Next Advance in Operations Research",
Operation Research, pages 1-10, January-February 1958.]

Subject: [2-3] Agents

http://www.cs.umbc.edu/agentslist/

The Software Agents Mailing List is devoted to the issues of software
agents, personal digital assistants, software robots, knowbots,
intelligent interface agents, etc. The term agent is ill-defined and
because of this the scope of this mailing list will also be somewhat
ill-defined. However, it should be restricted to software agents as
opposed to hardware (robots) and human agents (your travel agent).
(Although the interface from software agents to other agents is fair
game.) The list was begun in 1994 by Ray Johnson, then at the Lockheed
Palo Alto AI Center and now at Sun. In the Fall of 1996 it moved to
UMBC.

JOURNAL OF MACHINE LEARNING RESEARCH 

e Journal of Machine Learning Research (JMLR) provides an
international forum for the electronic and paper publication of
high-quality scholarly articles in all areas of machine learning.
JMLR seeks previously unpublished papers that contain:

    new algorithms with empirical, theoretical, psychological, or 
    biological justification; 
    experimental and/or theoretical studies yielding new insight
    into the design and behavior of learning in intelligent systems; 
    accounts of applications of existing techniques that shed light
    on the strengths and weaknesses of the methods; 
    formalization of new learning tasks (e.g., in the context of
    new applications) and of methods for assessing performance on
    those tasks; 
    development of new analytical frameworks that advance theoretical
    studies of practical learning methods; 
    computational models of data from natural learning systems at
    the behavioral or neural level; or 
    extremely well-written surveys of existing work. 

JMLR has a commitment to rigorous yet rapid reviewing; our goal is to
return reviews within six weeks of paper submission. Final versions
are published electronically (ISSN 1533-7928) immediately upon
receipt, and a quarterly paper volume (ISSN 1532-4435) is published
and sold to libraries and individuals by the MIT Press.

This part of the AI FAQ provides a bibliography of good introductory
texts, overviews of AI and specific subfields of AI, and some
important papers in those subfields. If you feel that there is a
reference or set of references which should be added to this FAQ, or
references which should be removed, please send email to
crabbe@usna.edu or adubey@coli.uni-sb.de.  When suggesting references
to be included in a particular subfield, only suggest the best two or
three references (or a particularly well-written overview). It is NOT
the intention of this listing to be a comprehensive AI bibliography.

Books suggested by their authors must present a strongly argued case.

"ResearchIndex is a scientific literature digital library that aims to
improve the dissemination and feedback of scientific literature, and
to provide improvements in functionality, usability, availability,
cost, comprehensiveness, efficiency, and timeliness.

Rather than creating just another digital library, ResearchIndex
provides algorithms, techniques, and software that can be used in
other digital libraries. ResearchIndex indexes Postscript and PDF

http://citeseer.nj.nec.com/cs

Research index (though most people still call it citeseer) is the
currently best way to find published papers AND TRACK CITATIONS.  It
is so cool, it's in the FAQ twice. (now 3 times).

UPDATE 4/1/04:  ResearchIndex has been sick, and updates stopped.  It
has been moved to: http://citeseer.ist.psu.edu/cis where hopefully it
will continue.

Subject: [4-36] How do I get a copy of the proceedings to conference <x>?

First, ask your librarian for help. If your local library doesn't have it,
they may be able to get it on interlibrary loan.

If you want to buy your own copy, first check with the organization
that ran the conference. See part 3 of the AI FAQ for a list of many
of the AI organizations that sponsor conferences.

If they can't help you, contact the Institute for Scientific Information
(ISI), and look up the proceedings in their Index to Scientific and
Technical Proceedings (ISTP volumes). You can contact the ISI at

   Institute for Scientific Information, Inc.
   3501 Market Street
   Philadelphia, PA 19104
   Phone: 215-386-0100

Subject: [4-37] How do I get a copy of <x>'s PhD dissertation?

Most dissertations from US universities are available from 

University Microfilms International, Inc.

Phone: 800-521-0600 (313-761-4700)
       800-343-5299 (in Canada)

They will print a copy of the dissertation from microfilm and bind it
in paperbound or cloth for a reasonable fee.

----------------------------------------------------------------
Subject: [4-38] How do I get Tech Report X?

The easiest and cheapest way to get a copy of a tech report, paper, or
thesis is to send email to the author. Most researchers will be happy
to drop a copy of the report to you in the mail, or give you a pointer
to an online copy. In some cases they may direct you to a central
technical report coordinator for their department (see [6-2]), and
getting a copy may involve a nominal fee.

If you think of questions that are appropriate for this FAQ, or would
like to improve an answer, please send email to the maintainers.

Parts 5 and 6 of the FAQ are now under heavy construction.  The FTP & WWW
resources have been combined, since both are browser accessible these
days.  We're also pruning the entries to sites that include
information other than whatever project is being done at that
University, etc.

Part 5 (WWW & FTP Resources):

Subject: [5-0] Research Index (nee Citeceer)

http://citeseer.nj.nec.com/cs

"ResearchIndex is a scientific literature digital library that aims to
improve the dissemination and feedback of scientific literature, and
to provide improvements in functionality, usability, availability,
cost, comprehensiveness, efficiency, and timeliness.

Rather than creating just another digital library, ResearchIndex
provides algorithms, techniques, and software that can be used in
other digital libraries. ResearchIndex indexes Postscript and PDF
research articles on the Web..."

http://citeseer.nj.nec.com/cs

Research index (though most people still call it citeseer) is the
currently best way to find published papers AND TRACK CITATIONS.  It
is so cool, it's in the FAQ twice.

UPDATE 4/1/04:  ResearchIndex has been sick, and updates stopped.  It
has been moved to: http://citeseer.ist.psu.edu/cis where hopefully it
will continue.

AI Toolkit:

   The AI Toolkit is an educational software package developed to
   train future and current scientists and engineers on Artificial
   Intelligence methods, with a specific focus on soft computing
   techniques for robotic applications. The software is designed to be
   completely user-friendly, and provide hands-on interactive lessons
   to enhance understanding and knowledge of these powerful
   methods. In addition, the multicultural interfaces promote a
   universal atmosphere to enhance learning.

   The AI Toolkit is now freely available for download at:
   http://www.openchannelsoftware.com/projects/AI_Toolkit

   For more information, visit:  http://aitoolkit.jpl.nasa.gov


AI Topics: 
   http://www.aaai.org/Pathfinder/html/welcome.html
   Presented by AAAI, AI Topics is a "...web site provided ... for
   students, teachers, journalists, and everyone who would like to
   learn more about what artificial intelligence is, and what AI
   scientists do.

   [Their] goal is to offer a limited number of authoritative,
   non-technical resources that [they] have organized and annotated
   to provide you with meaningful access to basic information about
   the AI universe. Each of the AI Topics (see the navigation buttons
   to the left) will lead you to online and in-print sources of
   information.

   There has been an explosion in the number of Websites that catalog
   locations of AI information in a Yahoo-style directory.  Although they
   often duplicate functionality, in the interest of fairness, I will list all
   the ones I know about here.

AboutAI.com:
   http://www.aboutai.net/
   It is a second generation portal and a successor to the former
   ai.about.com.  aboutAI.Net contains dozens of AI-related essays and
   thousands of Web links. It will be focused on the technical side,
   describing the implementation of a wide range of AI
   techniques. Site actively uses data mining techniques for
   collaboration filtering, information retrieval, automatic
   classification of retrieved information, etc.

Kurzweilai.Net:
   http://www.kurzweilai.net
   An entertaining mix of flashy demos and interesting essays on AI,
   many by important poeple in the field.  Much philosophical
   discussion, less hard-core technical discussion.

MAKHFI

   A site dedicated to Neural Networks, including some open source
   tools that they developed.

	http://www.makhfi.com

   The site is still not complete, but we are fully committed to make
   it "the" resource site for ANN.

Neuron AI Directory
   http://www.neuron.co.uk 

Neural Network Information in Polish:
   http://www.neuron.of.pl

Generation 5:
   http://www.generation5.org

   "Generation5 is aimed at presenting a website that will educate the
   viewer on Artificial Intelligence -- whatever the level of
   expertise. We have essays on the applications and history of AI for
   those unfamiliar, to essays on programming and philosophy, all the way
   to full blown mathematically-orientated essays on genetic algorithms
   and neural networks.  Generation5 prides itself also in its interviews
   sections with exclusive interviews from top AI scientists like Marvin
   Minsky, Craig Reynolds, Roger Schank, Andre LaMothe and many
   others. Generation5 also has a comprehensive collection of original
   programs, all with source included. Demonstration programs like image
   recognizors, number recognizors, cellular automata creators, NLP
   demonstrator and more. All programs have an accompanying essay
   describing the workings of the programs.

   The aim of Generation5 is not only to educate the viewer, but to allow
   the viewer to contribute to further other people's knowledge. They can
   do this through the discussion boards, voting systems, and soon
   through AI Solutions (a scheme to submit code - with a accompanying
   monthly competition)."


Yahoo Clubs:
   Yahoo maintains a number of AI clubs.  There is the general
   AI Group, an online community that discusses AI (a resource
   for beginners).  Their website is:

      http://clubs.yahoo.com/clubs/artificialintelligencegroup

   There is also a resource for amateur robot enthusiasts at:

      http://clubs.yahoo.com/clubs/theroboticsclub

Pentomino Site:
   http://home.planetinternet.be/~odettedm
   Student run site at T.I.D. Ronse Belgium on searching Pentomino
   spaces.

Subject: [5-2] Repositories aimed primarily for researchers


CMU AI Repository:

   The CMU Artificial Intelligence Repository was established by
   Carnegie Mellon University to contain public domain and freely
   distributable software, publications, and other materials of
   interest to AI researchers, educators, students, and practitioners. 
   The AI Repository currently contains more than a gigabyte of
   material and is growing steadily. 

   The AI Repository is accessible from:

      http://www.cs.cmu.edu/Web/Groups/AI/html/repository.html

ACT-R Faq:
   
   http://acs.ist.psu.edu/act-r-faq/
   "ACT-R is a proposed unified theory of cognition realised as a
   production system. It is a unified theory of cognition, in the
   spirit proposed by Newell (1990, Unified theories of cognition,
   Harvard, Cambridge, MA), in that it is designed to predict human
   behavior by processing information and generating intelligent
   behavior itself."



Soar Faq:

   http://acs.ist.psu.edu/soar-faq/soar-faq.html
   "Soar is used by AI researchers to construct integrated intelligent
   agents and by cognitive scientist for cognitive modeling. It can
   basically be considered in three different ways:
   1. A theory of cognition. As such it provides the principles behind
   the implemented Soar system. 
   2. A set of principles and constraints on (cognitive)
   processing. Thus, it provides a (cognitive) architectural
   framework, within which you can construct cognitive models. In this
   view it can be considered as an integrated architecture for
   knowledge-based problem solving, learning and interacting with
   external environments. 
   3. An AI programming language."

Subject: [5-5] Technical Reports available by WWW/FTP

This section lists the anonymous ftp sites for technical reports from
several universities and other organizations. Some of the sites
provide only an online catalog of technical reports, while the rest
make the actual reports available online. The email address listed is
that of the appropriate person to contact with questions about
ordering technical reports. 

The main source of tech reports is now from Networked Computer Science
Technical Reference Library  or NCSTRL (pronounced "ancestral").
It's home page is: http://www.ncstrl.org/  
If that is a problem, you can go directly to:
http://cs-tr.cs.cornell.edu/


Other general locations for technical reports from several
universities include:

   wuarchive.wustl.edu:/doc/techreports/ [128.252.135.4]
   cs-archive.uwaterloo.ca:/cs-archive/  (see Index for an index)
      AKA watdragon.uwaterloo.ca [129.97.140.24]

The uwaterloo archive includes tech reports from the Logic Programming
and Artificial Intelligence Group (LPAIG) of the University of Waterloo.

There is also a WAIS server containing tech report abstracts that can be
searched. To use, create the file ~/wais-sources/cs-techreport-abstracts.src 
containing
   (:source
      :version  3
      :ip-address "130.194.74.201"
      :ip-name "daneel.rdt.monash.edu.au"
      :tcp-port 210
      :database-name "cs-techreport-abstracts"
      :cost 0.00
      :cost-unit :free
      :maintainer "wais@daneel.rdt.monash.edu.au")
and invoke your local wais client. To add to it, email abstracts of
your papers to wais@rdt.monash.edu.au in the following format:
   %TI Title
   %AU Author (use multiple %AU lines for multiple authors)
   %PU Published In (citation information)
   %AV Availability (e.g., ftp reports.adm.cs.cmu.edu:/1992/CMU-CS-92-101.ps)
   %OR Organization (see cs-techreport-archives.src for institution codes)
   %LT Local title (e.g., tech report number)
   %DA Date (and, if you want, %MN Month, %YR Year)
   %AB Abstract
If your papers are not available by FTP, you can use a %AV line such as:
   %AV mail harry.bovik@cs.cmu.edu
Further instructions are available from
   daneel.rdt.monash.edu.au:/pub/techreports/reports/README  
[Based on a post by Ashwin Ram.]

Linguistic Data Consortium:

   The Linguistic Data Consortium was established to broaden the
   collection and distribution of speech and natural language data
   bases for the purposes of research and technology development in
   automatic speech recognition, natural language processing, and
   other areas where large amounts of linguistic data are needed.  LDC
   corpora are the most commonly used in published research.
   Information about the LDC is at http://www.ldc.upenn.edu/

   A list of 110,000 English words (one per line, in ASCII) is
   available in the PD1:<MSDOS.LINGUISTICS> directory on SIMTEL20 as the
   files WORDS1.ZIP, WORDS2.ZIP, WORDS3.ZIP, and WORDS4.ZIP. Although the
   list is in MS-DOS files, it can easily be used on other machines (but
   first you'll have to unzip the files on a DOS machine). The list
   includes inflected forms of the words, such as plural nouns and the
   -s, -ed, and -ing forms of verbs; thus the number of lexical stems in
   the list is considerably smaller than the total number of word forms.
   These files are available via FTP from WSMR-SIMTEL20.ARMY.MIL
   [192.88.110.20].  SIMTEL20 files are mirrored on wuarchive.wustl.edu.

MLnet Machine Learning Archive
MLnet Online Information Service

   In 1988 the Special Interest Group on Machine Learning of the German
   Society for Computer Science (GI e.V.) decided to establish a library
   of PROLOG implementations of Machine Learning algorithms.  By 1994 the
   library had a sizable collection of GLPed PROLOG software.  The site
   has grown, and now, according to the webpage it "offers a growing
   collection of ML information, datasets, software and pointers to other
   ML resources."  The homepage is at:

Subject: [6-1] Languages

   Its assumed that you can find your way to common languages like
   LISP, C++ or Prolog by doing a web search; what are listed here are
   some other languages that AI researchers may find
   interesting. [Because I had trouble finding a good prolog recently,
   I've added some prolog listings here.]

   XSB Prolog:

   XSB is a Logic Programming and Deductive Database system for Unix
   and Windows. It is being developed at The Computer Science
   Department, Stony Brook University, in collaboration with
   Katholieke Universiteit Leuven, Universidade Nova de Lisboa, and
   Uppsala Universitet.  http://xsb.sourceforge.net/

   Amzi! Prolog + Logic Server:

   "Embed Prolog rule-based components in C/C++, Java, Delphi, Visual
   Basic, Web Servers and more. Develop Unicode and/or ASCII
   logic-bases using the Windows interactive development environment
   (IDE). Integrate them with ODBC databases. Deploy them with the
   Logic Server Libraries. Extend Amzi! Prolog with your own
   functions/libraries. For Windows, Linux, Solaris, HP/UX. Available
   on any other platform with a custom port (see below). Royalty-free
   runtime"  http://www.amzi.com/products/prolog_products.htm
   Free Academic, Personal & Evaluation License.

   Mozart:

   Mozart is an advanced development platform for intelligent,
   distributed applications.  The system is the result of a decade of
   research in programming language design and implementation,
   constraint-based inferencing, distributed computing, and
   human-computer interfaces.
   

   JEOPS - The Java Embedded Object Production System:

   It's a project intended to give Java the power of production
   systems. JEOPS adds forward chaining, first-order production rules
   to Java through a set of classes designed to provide this language
   with some kind of declarative programming. With that, the
   development of intelligent applications, such as software agents or
   expert systems is facilitated.
   http://www.di.ufpe.br/~csff/jeops/

   KIEV:

   Kiev is a backwards-compatible extension of Java that includes support
   for (amount other things) lambda-calculus closures (ie functional
   programming) and Prolog-like logic programming.  Please see
   http://www.forestro.com/kiev/index.html

   LAMBDA-CALCULUS-BASED LANGUAGES:

   LISP's theoretical origins lie in Church's lambda calculus.  A number of
   new languages that fix some shortcomings of LISP's implementation of the
   lambda calculus are Scheme (simpler and fully tail recursive), ML
   (support for types using the typed lambda calculus;
   cm.bell-labs.com/cm/cs/what/smlnj/sml97.html) and Hashell (like ML but
   it implements lazy evaluation properly; www.haskell.org).

   POPLOG:
   
   POPLOG is a multi-language software development environment
   providing incremental compilers for a number of interactive
   programming languages, notably: Pop-11, Prolog, and Common Lisp.  
   http://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/research/poplog/poplog.info.html

   CLIPS:

   CLIPS is a productive development and delivery expert system tool
   which provides a complete environment for the construction of rule
   and/or object based expert systems. CLIPS is used throughout the
   public and private community including: all NASA sites and branches
   of the military, numerous federal bureaus, government contractors,
   universities, and many companies.  The CLIPS home page is:
   http://www.ghgcorp.com/clips/CLIPS.html 

   SCREAMER:

   Screamer is an extension of Common Lisp that adds support for
   nondeterministic programming.  Screamer consists of two levels.  The
   basic nondeterministic level adds support for backtracking and
   undoable side effects.  On top of this nondeterministic substrate,
   Screamer provides a comprehensive constraint programming language in
   which one can formulate and solve mixed systems of numeric and
   symbolic constraints.  Together, these two levels augment Common Lisp
   with practically all of the functionality of both Prolog and
   constraint logic programming languages such as CHiP and CLP(R).
   Furthermore, Screamer is fully integrated with Common Lisp. Screamer
   programs can coexist and interoperate with other extensions to Common
   Lisp such as CLOS, CLIM and Iterate.

   In several ways Screamer is more efficient than other implementations
   of backtracking languages.  First, Screamer code is transformed into
   Common Lisp which can be compiled by the underlying Common Lisp
   system.  Many competing implementations of nondeterministic Lisp are
   interpreters and thus are far less efficient than Screamer.  Second,
   the backtracking primitives require fairly low overhead in Screamer.
   Finally, this overhead to support backtracking is only paid for those
   portions of the program which use the backtracking primitives.
   Deterministic portions of user programs pass through the Screamer to
   Common Lisp transformation unchanged.  Since in practise, only small
   portions of typical programs utilize the backtracking primitives,
   Screamer can produce more efficient code than compilers for languages
   in which backtracking is more pervasive.

   Screamer is fairly portable across most Common Lisp implementations.
   It currently runs under Genera 8.1.1 and 8.3 on both Symbolics 36xx
   and Ivory machines, under Lucid 4.0.2 and 4.1 on Sun SPARC machines,
   under MCL 2.0 and 2.0p2 on Apple Macintosh machines, and under Poplog
   Common Lisp on Sun SPARC machines.  It should run under any
   implementation of Common Lisp which is compliant with CLtL2 and with
   minor revision could be made to run under implementations compliant
   with CLtL1 or dpANS.

   Screamer is available by anonymous FTP from 

      ftp.cis.upenn.edu:/pub/screamer.tar.Z

Subject: [6-4] Agent Modelling - Artificial Life

In addition to programs available free by anonymous ftp, we've
included some programs which are available by contacting the authors,
and some programs which charge a nominal fee.

Agent Modelling:

   ANIMALS is a simulation system written by Toby Tyrrell,
   <toby@castle.ed.ac.uk>, for his PhD thesis.  The thesis examines the
   problem of action selection when dealing with realistic, animal-like
   situations: how to choose, at each moment in time, the most
   appropriate out of a repertoire of possible actions.  It includes a
   description is given of a simulated environment which is an extensive
   and detailed simulation of the problem of action selection for
   animals.  This simulated environment is used to investigate the
   adequacy of several theories of action selection (from both ethology
   and artificial intelligence) such as the drive model, Lorenz's
   psycho-hydraulic model and Maes' spreading activation network, and
   outlines deficiencies in each mechanism. Finally, it proposes a new
   approach to action selection is developed which determines the most
   appropriate action in a principled way, and which does not suffer from
   the inherent shortcomings found in other methods. The thesis includes
   a review and bibliography of existing work on action selection. The
   thesis is available by anonymous ftp from 

      ftp.ed.ac.uk:/pub/lrtt/ [129.215.146.5]

   as the files as.1.ps.Z, as.2.ps.Z, ..., and as.7.ps.Z.
   The simulation software is also available from the same site, as the
   file se.tar.Z. The simulation software was written in Suntools rather
   than Xtools.  It can be run only from SunView or OpenWindows.  The
   action selection problem modelled by the simulated environment
   comprises 15 different `sub-problems' (getting food, reproducing, not
   getting lost, being vigilant for predators, etc), many internal and
   external stimuli, and 35 different low-level actions to select
   between.

   ***ViewGen SCHEDULED TO BE DELETED FROM THE FAQ***

   ViewGen (Viewpoint Generator) is a Prolog program that implements a
   "Belief Ascription Algorithm" as described in Ballim and Wilks (see the
   bibliography section on User Modelling).  This can be seen as a form of
   agent modelling tool, which allows for the generation of arbitrarily deep
   nested belief spaces based on the system's own beliefs, and on beliefs 
   that are typically held by groups of agents.  ViewGen is available by
   anonymous ftp from 

      crl.nmsu.edu:/pub/non-lexical/ViewFinder [128.123.1.18] (user anonymous)
      ftp.ims.uni-stuttgart.de:/pub/ballim    [141.58.127.8] (user ftp)

   as the file ViewGen.tar.Z. The theory of belief ascription upon which
   it is based is described in detail in Ballim and Wilks, and a general
   framework for attributing and maintaining nested propositional
   attitudes is described in Afzal Ballim's dissertation which is
   archived with the Viewgen program (in the files 

      ViewFinder-{A4/A5/US}.tar.Z, 

   the variable part indicating the format of the PostScript file).
   The inheritance reasoner is in the file vf-hetis.tar.Z.
   Implemented in Sicstus prolog, and hence easily convertible to
   any Edinburgh-style prolog. Contact Afzal Ballim <afzal@divsun.unige.ch>

   One of the major institutions do Artificial Life research, The
   Santa Fe Institute's web page has lots  of information.

   Swarm is a software package for multi-agent simulation of complex
   systems, originally developed at the Santa Fe Institute. Swarm is
   intended to be a useful tool for researchers in a variety of
   disciplines. The basic architecture of Swarm is the simulation of
   collections of concurrently interacting agents: with this
   architecture, we can implement a large variety of agent based models.
   See: http://www.swarm.org/

   Tierra is an artificial life system for studying the evolution of
   digital organisms. Tierra consists of a virtual computer and its
   operating system, whose architecture has been designed in such a way
   that the executable machine codes are evolvable.  This means that the
   machine code can be mutated (by flipping bits at random) or recombined
   (by swapping segments of code between algorithms), and the resulting
   code remains functional enough of the time for natural (or presumably
   artificial) selection to be able to improve the code over time.
   Tierra runs on Unix, Win32, the Amiga and MS-DOS. Tierra's homepage is at:

	  http://www.isd.atr.co.jp/~ray/tierra/

   The software can be downloaded from

      alife.santafe.edu:/pub/SOFTWARE/Tierra [192.12.12.130]

   To be added to the tierra-announce mailing list, send an email to
   Tom Ray (the author of Tierra as well as the list administrator) at
   ray@santafe.edu.  Send bug reports or questions about the code or
   installation to tierra-bug@life.slhs.udel.edu.

   For those without access to anonymous ftp, the Tierra software may be
   obtained on disk for $50 ($20 for upgrades) from Virtual Life c/o Tom Ray,
   ATR HIP Labs, 2-2 Hikaridai Seika-cho Soraku-gun Kyoto 619-02 Japan.  The

Constraint Programming and Non-determinism:

   Dragonbreath http://www.ai-center.com/projects/dragonbreath/ is an
   optimization engine based on constraint programming and local
   search.  The engine is built to solve search problems, i.e.,
   problems for which you don't really know how to construct a
   solution but can describe what potential parts a solution can
   consist of and which restrictions must be satisfied by the parts /
   the parts' constellation.  Parts can be variables as well as
   structural components. In addition, you can specify a preference
   between different solutions, i.e., solve optimization problems.

Defeasible Reasoning:

   An implementation of J. Paris and A. Vencovska's model of belief is
   available by anonymous ftp from

      ftp.cs.cmu.edu:/user/ai/areas/reasonng/defeasbl/belief/

   Paris and Vencovska's paper (Artificial Intelligence, 64(2), December
   1993) provides a mathematical model of an agent's belief in an event
   by identifying it with his ability to imagine the event within the
   context of his previous experience.  This approach leads to beliefs
   having properties different from those normally ascribed to it. The
   implementation was written by Ian Pratt <ipratt@cs.man.ac.uk> and Jens

   GPQUICK is a simple GP system implemented in C++.  It features an
   elegant object architecture with function (Function), program
   (Chrome), GA (Pop) and problem (Problem) classes.  The Problem class
   is proposed as a portable representation for problems that would be
   source compatible with a variety of other GP systems.  GPQUICK uses a
   steady state GA, tournament selection, one type of mutation, and
   subtree crossover.  It uses a fast, compact linear representation for
   S-expressions. It includes documentation from the associated magazine
   article (Byte, "Some Assembly Required", February 1994). GPQUICK is
   available by anonymous ftp from
      ftp.cc.utexas.edu:/pub/genetic-programming/code/
   as the files gpquick.tar (unix version, tested with CC and g++) and

   SNePS (Semantic Network Processing System) is the implementation of a
   fully intensional theory of propositional knowledge representation and
   reasoning. SNePS includes a module for creating and accessing
   propositional semantic networks, path-based inference, node-based
   inference based on SWM (a relevance logic with quantification) that
   uses natural deduction and can deal with recursive rules, forward,
   backward and bi-directional inference, nonstandard logical connectives
   and quantifiers, an assumption based TMS for belief revision (SNeBR), a
   morphological analyzer and a generalized ATN (GATN) parser for parsing
   and generating natural language, SNePSLOG, a predicate-logic-style
   interface to SNePS, XGinseng, an X-based graphics interface for
   displaying, creating and editing SNePS networks, SNACTor, a
   preliminary version of the SNePS Acting component, and SNIP 2.2, a new
   implementation of the SNePS Inference Package that uses rule shadowing
   and knowledge migration to speed up inference.  SNeRE (the SNePS
   Rational Engine), which is part of Deepak Kumar's dissertation about
   the integration of inference and acting, will replace the current
   implementation of SNACTor.  SNePS is written in Common Lisp, and has
   been tested in Allegro CL 4.1, Lucid CL 4.0, TI Common Lisp, CLISP
   May-93, and CMU CL 17b. It should also run in Symbolics CL, AKCL 1.600

   MOBAL is a system for developing operational models of application
   domains in a first order logic representation. It integrates a manual
   knowledge acquisition and inspection environment, an inference engine,
   machine learning methods for automated knowledge acquisition, and a
   knowledge revision tool.  By using MOBAL's knowledge acquisition
   environment, you can incrementally develop a model of your domain in
   terms of logical facts and rules.  You can inspect the knowledge you
   have entered in text or graphics windows, augment the knowledge, or
   change it at any time. The built-in inference engine can immediately
   execute the rules you have entered to show you the consequences of
   your inputs, or answer queries about the current knowledge. MOBAL also
   builds a dynamic sort taxonomy from your inputs. If you wish, you can
   use several machine learning methods to automatically discover
   additional rules based on the facts that you have entered, or to form
   new concepts. If there are contradictions in the knowledge base due to
   incorrect rules or facts, there is a knowledge revision tool to help
   you locate the problem and fix it.  MOBAL (release 3.0b) is available
   free for non-commercial academic use by anonymous ftp from

      ftp.gmd.de:/gmd/mlt/Mobal/

   The system runs on Sun SparcStations, SunOS 4.1, and includes a
   graphical interface implemented using Tcl/TK.

   PEBLS (Parallel Exemplar-Based Learning System) is a nearest-neighbor

   OC1 (Oblique Classifier 1) is a multivariate decision tree induction
   system designed for applications where the instances have numeric
   feature values.  OC1 builds decision trees that contain linear
   combinations of one or more attributes at each internal node; these
   trees then partition the space of examples with both oblique and
   axis-parallel hyperplanes.  OC1 has been used for classification of
   data from several real world domains, such as astronomy and cancer
   diagnosis.  A technical decription of the algorithm can be found in
   the AAAI-93 paper by Sreerama K. Murthy, Simon Kasif, Steven Salzberg
   and Richard Beigel.  A postscript version of this paper is included in
   the distribution. OC1 is a written entirely in ANSI C. OC1 is

   Set-Enumeration (SE) Trees for Induction/Classification. Significant
   research in Machine Learning, and in Statistics, has been devoted to
   the induction and use of decision trees as classifiers.  An induction
   framework which generalizes decision trees using a Set-Enumeration
   (SE) tree is outlined in  

      Rymon, R. (1993), An SE-tree-based Characterization of the Induction
      Problem. In Proc. of the Tenth International Conference on Machine
      Learning, Amherst MA, pp. 268-275.

   In this framework, called SE-Learn, rather than splitting according to
   a single attribute, one recursively branches on all (or most) relevant
   attributes. An induced SE-tree can be shown to economically embed many
   decision trees, thereby supporting a more expressive hypothesis
   representation. Also, by branching on many attributes, SE-Learn
   removes much of the algorithm-dependent search bias. Implementations
   of SE-Learn can benefit from many techniques developed for decision
   trees (e.g., attribute-selection and pruning measures). In particular,
   SE-Learn can be tailored to start off with one's favorite decision
   tree, and then improve upon it by further exploring the SE-tree. This
   hill-climbing algorithm allows trading time/space for added accuracy.
   Current studies (yet unpublished) show that SE-trees are particularly
   advantageous in domains where (relatively) few examples are available
   for training, and in noisy domains. Finally, SE-trees can provide a
   unified framework for combining induced knowledge with knowledge
   available from other sources (Rymon, 1994).

   system. Each of the grammars comes with a set of parsers, such as 
   Earley-like chart parsers, left-corner parsers and head-driven
   parsers. Some grammars come with variants of the head-driven
   generator. The package allows easy comparison of different
   parsers/generators, extensive possibilities of compiling feature
   equations into Prolog terms, graphical (Tk), LaTeX and ordinary Prolog
   output of trees, feature structures and Prolog terms, and plotted
   graphs and tables of statistical information. Hdrug runs in Sicstus
   Prolog and requires ProTcl and Tcl/Tk. It is available by anonymous

   channels on and off, the original Hodgkin-Huxley model, the SWIM model
   (a modified HH model) and the Golowasch-Buchholz model (the most
   enhanced model). Dendrites consist of a chain of segments without
   bifurcation.  It is in the public domain and runs on Unix workstations
   (a less-powerful PC version is also available). BIOSIM includes a
   graphical user interface and was designed for research and teaching.

    GENESIS (short for GEneral NEural SImulation System) is a general
    purpose simulation platform which was developed to support the
    simulation of neural systems ranging from complex models of single
    neurons to simulations of large networks made up of more abstract
    neuronal components. GENESIS has provided the basis for laboratory
    courses in neural simulation at both Caltech and the Marine
    Biological Laboratory in Woods Hole, MA, as well as many other
    institutions. Most current GENESIS applications involve realistic
    simulations of biological neural systems. Although the software
    can also model more abstract networks, other simulators are more
    suitable for backpropagation and similar connectionist modeling.

 * The ARS MAGNA abstract robot simulator provides an abstract world in
   which a planner controls a mobile robot. This abstract world is more
   realistic than typical blocks worlds, in which micro-world simplifying
   assumptions do not hold. Experiments may be controlled by varying
   global world parameters, such as perceptual noise, as well as building
   specific environments in order to exercise particular planner
   features. The world is also extensible to allow new experimental
   designs that were not thought of originally. The simulator also

   relatively few constraints on the form of the domain and the agents'
   abilities.  Users may specify the time required by various activities,
   the constraints on an agents' sensors, the configuration of the domain

   velocities with the Newton-Euler scheme, and communicates with the
   other two programs.  BEMMEL only displays the robot.  CONNEL is the
   controller, which must be designed by the user (in the distributed
   version, CONNEL is a simple inverse kinematics routine.)  The programs
   use Unix sockets for communication, so you must have sockets, but you
   can run the programs on different machines.  The software is available

               calendar/clock times, and bounds on durations. Data entry
               and retrieval is through interval or point relations.
               The system is scalable in the sense that storage
               remains linear in the number of relations added.
               Efficient retrieval is achieved through a simple

   TimeGraph II (TG-II) handles the set of the relations of the Point
   Algebra and of the Pointizable Interval Algebra (also called Simple
   Interval Algebra by P. van Beek). Temporal relations are represented
   through a "timegraph", a graph partitioned into a collection of "time
   chains" which are automatically structured for efficiency. The system
   is scalable, in the sense that the storage tends to remain linear in
   the number of relations asserted. Efficient query handling is achieved
   through a time point numbering scheme and a "metagraph" data
   structure. TG-II is written in Common Lisp.  For a description of the
   theory underlying the system see:

   KEIM is a collection of software modules, written in Common Lisp with
   CLOS, designed to be used in the production of theorem proving
   systems.  KEIM is intended to be used by those who want to build or
   use deduction systems (such as resolution theorem provers) without
   having to write the entire framework. KEIM is also suitable for
   embedding a reasoning component into another Common Lisp program.
   KEIM offers a range of datatypes implementing a logical language of
   type theory (higher order logic), in which first order logic can be
   embedded.  KEIM's datatypes and algorithms include: types; terms
   (symbols, applications, abstractions), environments (e.g., associating
   symbols with types); unification and substitutions; proofs, including
   resolution and natural deduction style. KEIM also provides
   functionality for the pretty-printing, error handling, formula parsing
   and user interface facilities which form a large part of any theorem
   prover. Implementing with KEIM thus allows the programmer to avoid a
   great deal of drudgery.  KEIM has been tested in Allegro CL 4.1 and
   Lucid CL 4.0 on Sun 4 workstations.  KEIM is available for
   noncommercial use via anonymous FTP from

      js-sfbsun.cs.uni-sb.de:/pub/keim/keim*

   list for KEIM users is also being set up.  Send mail to
   keim-users-request@cs.uni-sb.de to be put on the list.

   Nqthm-1992 is the Boyer-Moore theorem prover. The 1992 version of the
   theorem prover is upwardly compatible with the previous (1987)
   version. Included in the distribution are thousands of Nqthm-checked
   theorems formulated by Bevier, Boyer, Brock, Bronstein, Cowles,
   Flatau, Hunt, Kaufmann, Kunen, Moore, Nagayama, Russinoff, Shankar,
   Talcott, Wilding, Yu, and others. The release of Nqthm-1992 includes
   three revised chapters of the book `A Computational Logic Handbook',
   including Chapter 4, on the formal logic for which the system is a
   prover, and Chapter 12, the reference guide to user commands.  Nqthm
   runs in Common Lisp, and has been tested in AKCL, CMU CL, Allegro CL,
   Lucid CL, MCL, and Symbolics CL. Nqthm-1992 is available by anonymous
   ftp from

      ftp.cli.com:/pub/nqthm/nqthm-1992/  [192.31.85.129]

   The TPTP (Thousands of Problems for Theorem Provers) Problem Library
   is a collection of test problems for automated theorem provers (ATPs),
   using the clausal normal form of 1st order predicate logic.  The goal
   of the TPTP is to provide a firm basis for the testing, evaluation,
   and comparison of ATP systems through a comprehensive library of ATP
   test problems in a general purpose format. The TPTP includes tools to
   convert the problems to existing ATP formats, such as the OTTER, MGTP,
   PTTP, SETHEO, and SPRFN formats.  Each problem includes a list of
   references and other relevant information.  The TPTP also aims to
   supply general guidelines outlining the requirements for ATP system
   evaluation. The TPTP can be obtained by anonymous ftp from either the
   Department of Computer Science, James Cook University, Australia,

      coral.cs.jcu.edu.au:/pub/research/tptp-library/   [137.219.17.4]
